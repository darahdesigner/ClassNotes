    html:
    -Create two seperate divs within the body element.
    -Give those divs a class name of "container"
    -Within each of the divs, create an h1 tag and a paragraph tag
    -Fill the h1 with whatever heading you want but for the paragraph tag, find some lorem ipsum to use by making a "lorem ipsum" google search

    css:
    -Make the heading tags bold and purple
    -Make the paragraph tags green with some words italicized
    -Make the background color of the entire document black
    -Align the two divs so that they are side by side, and centered horizontally as well as vertically.
