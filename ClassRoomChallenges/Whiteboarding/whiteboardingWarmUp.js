//Warm up white boarding challenges

//Complete the challenge within a google doc

// Set up two varibles equal to any two integers
// Write a conditional that checks if the first varible is divisible by the second
// If it is console log `value of ${a} is divisble by value of ${b}`
// If it is not console log the remainder

let a = 10;
let b = 5;

if(a%b===0){
console.log(`Value of ${a} is divisible by value of ${b}`)
}else {console.log(a%b)
}


//Checking a string
//Complete the challenge within a google doc:
// STEP 1
//Write a conditional that checks if a string is empty
//If it is console log 'Please type something'
// STEP 2
//If it is not console log the string
// STEP 3

//if it does console log please type less

let entry = 'hello';
 
if(entry.length ===0){
console.log('Please type something');
}else if(entry.length >10){
console.log('Please type less');
